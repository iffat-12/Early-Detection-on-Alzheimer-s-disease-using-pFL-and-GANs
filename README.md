Ojectives:
* Timely Intervention: Identify the disease at its earliest stages to enable prompt medical and lifestyle interventions that may slow down its progression.
* Reduced Data Transmission: Minimize the need for large-scale data transfer, reducing bandwidth requirements and potential security risks associated with transmitting sensitive data using federated learning via GANs.
* Evaluate Performance: Quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the proposed methodâ€™s performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
